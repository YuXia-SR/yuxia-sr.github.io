I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Bain & Company, mentored by [Joshua Mabry](https://jmabry.github.io/about.html). Currently, I'm also working in Trustworthy AI Lab at University of California, Los Angeles, advised by Professor [Guang Cheng](https://faculty.stat.ucla.edu/guangcheng/index.html) and [Dr. Chi-Hua Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/chihuawang/home?authuser=0). My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and causal inference, leveraging biased real-world datasets and trustworthy synthetic data to improve decision-making in practical applications.

Previously, I was fortunate to work with Professor [Zhengyuan Zhou](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~zzhou/?_ga=2.64139943.965706804.1716675147-130836925.1712167643) at NYU Stern and [Dr. Aaron Mueller](https://aaronmueller.github.io/) at NYU CDS. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Data Science from New York University.
